## Accessing the websites - processing of personal data and type and purpose of use

When you visit our website, you transmit data to our web server via your Internet browser (for technical reasons). The following data is processed in the server log files during an ongoing connection for communication between your Internet browser and our web server:
- the page from which the file was requested - referrer URL
- the name of the file
- the date and time of the request
- a description of the type of web browser / browser version and operating system used
- IP address of the requesting computer
- Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
- Amount of data transferred

For technical reasons (accessing the website), this data may be stored temporarily. It is not possible for us to draw conclusions about individual persons from this data. The IP addresses are deleted or anonymised after 7 days at the latest.

The data is analysed exclusively for internal purposes and does not allow us to draw any conclusions about your person. A comparison with other databases does not take place.

This data is processed for the following purposes:

- Ensuring a proper and smooth connection to the website,
- Ensuring a comfortable use of the website,
- Analysing system security and stability

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above. Under no circumstances do we use the data collected for the purpose of drawing conclusions about your person. You can visit the website without providing any personal data.
Enquiries by e-mail or telephone

If you contact us by e-mail or telephone, your enquiry, including all resulting personal data (e.g. name, enquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. The data will not be passed on without your consent. There is no legal or contractual obligation to provide your data, but it is not possible to process your request without providing your data.

This data is processed on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your enquiry is related to the fulfilment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) and / or on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR), as we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing of the enquiries addressed to us.

The data sent to us via contact requests (e-mail) will be stored by us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.
Google Web Fonts

In order to display content correctly and graphically appealing across browsers, fonts from Google Fonts may be used on this website. Google Fonts is a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (Google). These web fonts are integrated by an external server call from Google. This tells the server which of the web pages you have visited. Furthermore, the IP address of the browser of the end device of the visitor to this website may be stored by Google.

The fonts are integrated on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. By integrating external fonts, we want to ensure, among other things, a needs-based, appealing design and the continuous optimisation of our website, as well as save loading times.

You can find more information in Google’s privacy policy, which you can access at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.
Data security

We use the TLS (Transport Layer Security) method for encryption on our website. You can recognise whether an individual page of our website is transmitted in encrypted form by the closed display of the key or lock symbol in the lower status bar of your browser.
Processing/disclosure of data

Your personal data will not be transferred to third parties for purposes other than those listed above or below. We only pass on your personal data to third parties if:

    you have given your express consent to this in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR,
    this is legally permissible and required in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR for the fulfilment of contractual relationships or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures with you,
    in the event that there is a legal obligation for the transfer in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. the processing pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

Right to object

You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1).
